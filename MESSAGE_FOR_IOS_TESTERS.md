**Subject:** iOS Build Coming Soon - Android Available Now

Hi [Tester Name],

Thanks for agreeing to test Knot! I wanted to let you know about the current build status:

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Android build** is ready and distributed
- ⏳ **iOS build** is coming soon (requires Mac to build)

**For Android users:**
You should have received an email from Firebase with a download link. If not, check your spam folder or let me know.

**For iOS users:**
Unfortunately, iOS builds require a Mac computer to compile, and I'm currently working on Windows. I'm exploring options to get an iOS build ready:

1. **Option 1:** I'll build it when I have access to a Mac
2. **Option 2:** I may use a cloud Mac service to build it
3. **Option 3:** We can set up TestFlight if I get an Apple Developer account

**Timeline:**
I'm working on getting iOS access set up. I'll send you an update as soon as the iOS build is ready.

**In the meantime:**
- If you have access to an Android device, you can test on that
- Or we can wait for the iOS build

Thanks for your patience!

## Alternative: Separate Groups

If you want to separate Android and iOS testers:

1. **Create separate groups in Firebase Console:**
   - "Android Testers"
   - "iOS Testers"

2. **Distribute to appropriate groups:**
   - Android builds → "Android Testers" group
   - iOS builds → "iOS Testers" group (when ready)

3. **Tell iOS testers:**
   "I've added you to the iOS testers group. You'll receive an email as soon as the iOS build is ready!"
